The Wwise Unity Integration is a Unity plugin plus API binding in Unity that allows the use of the Wwise sound engine in Unity games. It is referred to as the Integration in the rest of the document.

This file is part of the source distribution of the Integration. The distribution contains only the necessary files for rebuilding the Integration native plugin. The pre-built plugins, API bindings, example scripts, Unity Editor UI scripts, documentation, and tools are available in the redistributable unitypackage. The Integration and IntegrationDemo unitypackages are availabe as separate downloadable contents from Audiokinetic's official website.

Before taking any actions, we suggest that you read the documentation found in the Wwise/Documentation folder in the unitypackage, or on the Downloads page of our website.  Refer to the section "Build the Integration code" for additional details.
